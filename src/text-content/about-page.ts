  paragraph1:
    "Dadjokes is a simple platform dedicated to one thing: gloriously bad dad jokes. Whether it's a clever pun, an eye-roll one-liner, or a joke so bad it's good, this is the place to share it.",

  paragraph2:
    "Anyone can create an account and post their favorite dad jokes. You can also like other jokes to help surface the best (or worst) ones. Over time, the collection grows into a community-powered archive of pure dad humor.",

  paragraph3:
    "The goal is to keep things simple, fun, and accessible. No complicated features — just jokes, reactions, and a space to appreciate the art of the classic dad joke.",

  paragraph4:
    "If you've ever said, \"Hi hungry, I'm dad,\" you're in the right place.",
