Project: Pundad capstone fullstack app

Tech stack:

- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Auth: access token + refresh token flow
- Deployment: Railway/backend already in use, production-style setup
- UI includes sidebars, header/navbar, profile/dashboard, joke pages, featured pages, legal pages

Core app concept:

- Users can register, login, manage profile
- Create, edit, delete jokes
- Save drafts and publish later
- Comment on jokes
- Like jokes
- View daily joke, random joke, popular jokes, all jokes, search
- Hall of Fame / badges / featured joke systems
- Admin page for admin users

Important architecture decisions:

- User/profile is shared globally across languages
- dailyJokeStreak is global across languages by choice
- Content is language-separated between NO and EN
- App behaves like two separate apps/sites for content, except shared user/profile
- Language implemented in backend, database schema, and frontend

Database / backend language architecture:

- Added Language enum with NO and EN
- language-aware models include content-related entities
- languageMiddleware resolves request language from frontend
- routes under /api/v1 use language middleware
- services/controllers were updated to respect language
- language isolation is important: NO content should not leak into EN and vice versa
- featured jokes, tags, hall of fame, comments, likes, etc. were updated for language scoping
- streak remains global

Frontend language architecture:

- translations.ts contains NO and EN content
- LanguageContext provides current language and t()/tf()-style translation usage
- app language can come from localStorage, and user.preferredLanguage should be prioritized when logged in
- many pages/components already converted from hardcoded text to translations:
